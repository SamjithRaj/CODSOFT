# Java Programming Virtual Internship - CodSoft

## Overview
This repository contains the projects and exercises completed as part of the **Java Programming Virtual Internship** with CodSoft, running from **September 10, 2024, to October 10, 2024**.

The internship focuses on enhancing skills in **Java programming**, with a range of tasks designed to deepen understanding of core Java concepts, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and practical applications.

## Projects and Exercises

### 1. **Number Guessing Game**
A console-based Java game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. 
**Key features**:
- Limited attempts for guessing.
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Option to replay and track score.

**Key Concepts**: Loops, Conditionals, Random Number Generation, Input/Output handling.

### 2. **Student Grade Calculator**
A program to calculate and display student grades based on inputted scores.

**Key features**:

Input handling for multiple student scores.
Calculation of grades based on predefined criteria (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).
Displaying detailed student performance reports.
**Key Concepts**: Arrays, Loops, Conditional Statements, Input/Output handling, Methods.



### 3. **ATM Interface**
A console-based simulation of an ATM interface with functionalities such as balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal.
